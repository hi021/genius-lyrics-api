# genius-lyrics-api ðŸŽ¶ðŸŒˆ

The little Genius API that could.

A [fork](https://github.com/farshed/genius-lyrics-api) full of improvements with TypeScript typings.

Recommended to use with Node v22+

## Usage examples

### Song lookup by id - `getSongById`
Returns relevant song info, including album data and lyrics.

```ts
import { getSongById } from 'genius-lyrics-api';
const ids = [113119, 378195]

for(const id of ids) {
    console.log(`Results for "${id}":\n`,
        await getSongById(id, process.env.GENIUS_CLIENT_TOKEN)
    )
}
```

Genius API response can be then converted into a less-detailed, more friendly object using `parseSongInfo`.

If you're only interested in the lyrics, use `getLyrics` instead.

A real-life usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/hi021/okbot/blob/48cb725e7bf4909f3ac5be9ea22a71d5d6a916b5/src/commands/Utility/lyrics.ts#L75).

## Setup

1. Get a Genius API key [here](https://docs.genius.com),
2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hi021/genius-lyrics-api.git
cd genius-lyrics-api
```
3. Install required dependencies using your package manager of choice:

```
npm ci
```
```
pnpm install
```
```
yarn install
```
4. Transpile into executable JavaScript:

```
tsc
```
5. That's it! You can now use the project like any local package.
